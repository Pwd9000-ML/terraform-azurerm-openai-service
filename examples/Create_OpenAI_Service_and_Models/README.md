# Example: Create OpenAI Service and Models

This example module creates a new resource group, new cognitive OpenAI service, and two model deployments. It will then run a test to ensure the model deployment is working as expected and save the OpenAI Account and Model deployment details into an Azure Key Vault ready for consumption by other services.
