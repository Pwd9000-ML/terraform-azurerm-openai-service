      type = list(object({
        deployment_no   = (Required) The unique number of each model deployment (Numbered when saved in Azure KeyVault).
        deployment_id   = (Required) The name of the Cognitive Services Account `Model Deployment`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
        api_type        = (Required) The type of the Cognitive Services Account `Model Deployment`. Possible values are `azure`.
        model = {
          model_format  = (Required) The format of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible value is OpenAI.
          model         = (Required) The name of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          model_version = (Required) The version of Cognitive Services Account Deployment model.

        scale = {
          scale_type     = (Required) Deployment scale type. Possible value is Standard. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_tier     = (Optional) Possible values are Free, Basic, Standard, Premium, Enterprise. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_size     = (Optional) The SKU size. When the name field is the combination of tier and some other value, this would be the standalone code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_family   = (Optional) If the service has different generations of hardware, for the same SKU, then that can be captured here. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_capacity = (Optional) Tokens-per-Minute (TPM). If the SKU supports scale out/in then the capacity integer should be included. If scale out/in is not possible for the resource this may be omitted. Default value is 1. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
        }
        rai_policy_name = (Optional) The name of RAI policy. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
